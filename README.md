# Multiple Choice Code Quiz

## Description

A multiple-choice coding challenge.

In this weekâ€™s challenge I had to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. This timed quiz also stores high scores.

This quiz includes the following features:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

  - Questions that contain buttons for each answer.

  - When an answer is clicked, the next question appears.

  - If the answer clicked is incorrect, it subtracts time from the clock.

- The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  - When the game ends, it should display the users score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.
